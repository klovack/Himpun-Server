# Himpun Server

A simple Full Stack reddit-like forum website using

- React

- Typescript
- NodeJS
- Express
- Apollo

## Build and Start

Build the typescript using `yarn watch` and then start using `yarn start` 

or 

start it directly by using `yarn start:ts` 

## Configuration

For the connection to the database, this application uses TypeORM, hence we have the `ormconfig.yml` in the project directory.
In production, this `ormconfig.yml` has to be adjusted to point to the right database.
